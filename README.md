**`We Strive for Excellence`**

Increase your website's rating without losing the user experience by presenting a static HTML version of your JavaScript website to web crawlers.

> **Benefits of Pre Rendering a website.**

**Improves performance:**

In a React-app you need to wait for the JavaScript to be executed. Perhaps fetch data from an external API & then render the UI. There is a wait time for users. Whereas with the help of pre-rendering, HTML is already generated and loads more quickly.

**Helps with SEO:** 

If you are building a blog or an e-commerce site, SEO is a concern. Likewise with a React app, if the search engine hits your page it only sees a div tag with the id equal to root if your page is not pre-rendered. 
If a search engine hits a pre-rendered page though, all the content is present in the source code which will help index that page. Pre-rendering is the best practice to solve your concern about SEO.

**Faster Indexing:** 

Prerender instantly converts your JavaScript pages into HTML and caches them, ensuring complete caching of your website.
Pre-rendering enables search engines to index some content immediately. 

**Better user experience:** 

Google awards higher search ranks to websites with excellent user experiences. Therefore, improving your website for search engines also includes improving it for JavaScript UX and overall user experience.

**Increased web traffic:** 

To drive traffic to companies websites and generate revenue, the marketing team relies on technical SEO and web developers. resulting in ongoing improvement for both human users and search engines.
